# MyApp

This mini-project was implemented according to the official C # documentation (link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/console-teleprompter) and is one of the first steps towards learning C #.

## In the course of its implementation, we studied such functions of .NET Core and the C # language as:

1) .NET Core CLI basics;
2) The structure of a C # console application;
3) Console I / O;
4) .NET File I / O API Fundamentals
5) The basics of asynchronous programming based on Tasks in .NET;

As a result, an application was created that reads a text file and outputs the contents of this text file to the console. Console output is consistent with reading aloud. In addition, the user can speed up or slow down the tempo by pressing the <(less) or> (more) keys, and stop the text output to the console using "x" or "X".
